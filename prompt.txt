I need assistance in extracting metadata for a specific book title. The title in question is "{title}". Based on this title, could you provide the metadata in a structured JSON format? The required fields and format are as follows:

{
  "Title": "The actual title of the book",
  "Authors": ["List of authors, each as a separate item in the array"],
  "Publisher": "Name of the publishing company",
  "PublicationYear": "Year the book was published",
  "Genre": ["Primary genre of the book", "Secondary genre (if any)"],
  "Language": "Language the book is written in"
}

Please ensure the information is accurate and neatly organized within the JSON structure provided.
